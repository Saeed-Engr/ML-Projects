# Automatic Brain Tumor Grading System
A Brain Tumor Automatic Grading System (BTAGS) is a computer-based system designed to assist in the grading of brain tumors. It utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze medical images of brain tumors and provide accurate grading results.

The system typically takes as input magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and analyzes the images to identify the type of tumor, its location, and its size. The system can then use this information to classify the tumor into a particular grade, which is typically based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system.
